Globetrotters  

*****************

Globetrotters is an advanced Travel Companion Application using Google Maps. With the use of Geolocation, Google Maps API and implementing features such as searching, fetching and filtering data about nearby hotels, restaurants and attractions, this is an easy to use travel advisor application.

I have used [Travel Advisor API from Google](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/travel-advisor/) and [Open Weather Map API](https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map/) provided by [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hub).  The UI has been implemented using Material UI.
